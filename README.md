## About
I Started my development journey in 2020 with React. On 2024 November i switched to İOS dev.

Currently studying CS at Uskudar University and diving deep into <strong>iOS  development — learning, building, and trying to turn my ideas into real apps. Check out my repos [here](https://github.com/Canertsz?tab=repositories)
